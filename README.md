# CliEplTable

Hey there!

`epl` (short for cli_epl_gem) is a gem to view the current English Premier League table in your terminal.  You can view the full table or check individual teams for more statistics.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cli_epl_table'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cli_epl_table

## Usage

Once `cli_epl_table` is installed, all you have to do is type `epl` in your terminal.  It will load up the EPL table and you can explore from there.

<!-- ## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org). -->
